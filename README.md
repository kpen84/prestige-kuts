### Project Features

I created a website for my barber using node.js, express.js, and mongodb.

Vanilla JavaScipt was used to handle the slideshow displayed on the main page as well as the side-nav that is visible in mobile-view.

I used express to post appointments to the database however I did not complete the scripts required to get, update, or delete data. Those functions will be a focus on future projects.

There is an "admin page" where you can see appointments that have been booked, but I used MongoDB's built in "charts" tool to display them. It isn't a project requirement so I only did it for aesthetic
purposes.

Project was tested on multiple devices and passed.
