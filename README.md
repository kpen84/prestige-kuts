### Project Features

I created a website for my barber using node.js, express.js, and mongodb.

Vanilla JavaScipt was used to handle the slideshow displayed on the main page as well as the side-nav that is visible in mobile-view.

I used express to post appointments to the database however I did not complete the scripts required to get, update, or delete data. Those functions will be a focus on future projects.

Project was tested on multiple devices and passed.
